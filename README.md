**Abstract:** In this paper, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of the northern smooth-tailed treeshrew _Dendrogale murina_, which was sequenced for the first time using Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The total length of the mitogenome was 16,844-16,850 bp and contained 12S, 16S rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, 13 protein-coding genes, and a D-loop in the characteristic arrangement of family Tupaiidae, Scandentia. Overall base composition of the complete mitochondrial DNA is A (33.5%), C (25.5%), G (13.9%), and T (27.1%). Phylogenetic analysis of Scandentia mitochondrial genomes showed a classic pattern, revealed previously using individual phylogenetic markers, with the sister position of _Ptilocercus_ to _Dendrogale_ and _Tupaia_ genera. The separation time of the _Dendrogale_ genus is estimated as Eocene-Oligocene with the mean value 35.8 MYA, _Ptilocercus_ genus probably separated at about 46.3 MYA.
